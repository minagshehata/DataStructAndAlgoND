# Problem 5 : BlockChain

## Reasoning for the used data structure

Linked List : because it has the most efficient time to add block sequentially.

## Time and space complixity 
### Time complexity 
both of creating and adding a block operation is O(1) as the exection time is not affected by the input legnth 
### Space complexity 
the same is applied also for the space complexity.
